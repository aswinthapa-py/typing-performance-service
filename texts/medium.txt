Typing efficiently requires patience and discipline.
At first, your fingers may feel slow and uncoordinated, but this is normal.
With daily practice, muscle memory begins to develop naturally.

Accuracy should always be prioritized before speed.
Mistakes slow progress more than careful typing.
As confidence grows, speed will increase automatically.

Typing is not just about moving fingers quickly.
It is about rhythm, consistency, and focus.
Relaxed hands produce better results over time.

Many beginners try to type quickly and end up making more errors.
Slowing down helps improve precision and confidence.
Good habits formed early stay with you for years.

Typing regularly for short periods is better than long sessions done rarely.
Consistency builds long-lasting improvement.
Focus on progress, not perfection.
