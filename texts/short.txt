Typing is a skill that improves with regular practice.
Focus on accuracy before trying to increase speed.
Every correct keystroke builds confidence.

Small improvements each day lead to long-term success.
Stay relaxed and let your fingers move naturally.
Consistency matters more than intensity.

Good posture and calm breathing help improve typing flow.
Rushing creates mistakes and slows progress.
Slow and steady always wins.
